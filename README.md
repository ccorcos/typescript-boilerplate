# TypeScript Boilerplate

This is a simple setup for getting started building a web application using TypeScript, React, Redux, ImmutableJS, and Glamor.

## Getting Started

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ccorcos/typescript-boilerplate.git project
cd project
git remote remove origin
npm install
npm start
```

## To Do

- elmish version with subscriptions

- figure out how to make redux type definitions sound
- maybe build your own sound version of redux that can use all the middleware
